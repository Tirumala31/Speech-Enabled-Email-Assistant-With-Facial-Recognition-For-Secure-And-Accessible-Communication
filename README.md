In an increasingly digital world, accessibility and security in communication tools
have become critical, particularly for individuals with visual or physical impairments. Conventional email systems demand manual navigation and password-based
authentication, which can be cumbersome or inaccessible to some users. This project
presents a novel voice-controlled email system integrated with facial recognition
technology, aiming to offer a more secure and inclusive communication experience.
The system enables users to log in using facial biometrics and interact with email
functions entirely through voice commands. Key components include speech-totext conversion for composing emails, text-to-speech for reading emails aloud, and
secure login using face encodings generated via deep learning-based computer vision models such as ResNet-34. Developed using Python and Flask, and leveraging
libraries such as face recognition, Speech Recognition, and gTTS, the system interacts with email services through standard IMAP and SMTP protocols. The proposed
system is particularly suited for users who require hands-free functionality or rely on
assistive technologies, and it demonstrates the potential of combining artificial intelligence with human-centric design to improve digital inclusivity and security.This
model has demonstrated an accuracy of 99.38 on the Labeled Faces in the dataset,
indicating robust performance in facial verification tasks.
